Open Port Check Script

 This function fsockopen() is used in the Open Port Check Tool for our private blog. You can check whether a certain port is open on a specified IP address or hostname. Before reading take note that most FREE web hosting providers disable fsockopen() function as a security measure so first check whether the function can be used. Another thing to take note is that if fsockopen is unable to connect to a port it doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that port is closed on the remote host, your server in which the script is running might also have block the OUTBOUND connection to that port.
